## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Quite a fun little challenge, as usual doing the mobile first approach and this was the first time doing a doing with my Pro membership and learning all about Figma!

### Continued development

Didn't quite fully finish the background (the wave effect) so in future would like to do more reading up about how that could be achieved and hopefully fully complete the challenge!

Also still need to get my head around margins and padding. One day it will just click.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Box-shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) -
  Mainly used this site for the spoken property but did use it to discover if
  certain things would work they way they would (they didn't!)
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Still my go to website
  for all things web development
